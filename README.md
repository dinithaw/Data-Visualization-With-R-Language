**Time Series Decomposition**

**The decomposition revealed three key components:**

1. **Trend: Slight downward trend from 2005-2025**
    - **Production peaked around 2007-2008**
    - **Gradual decline with minor fluctuations**
    - **Recent years show more volatility**
2. **Seasonal Component:**
    - **Consistent seasonal patterns**
    - **Slight variations in production across different months**
    - **No dramatic seasonal shifts**
3. **Residual Component:**
    - **Random variations around the trend**
    - **No significant long-term irregular patterns**

**Stationarity Analysis**

- **Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test**
    - **p-value: Indicates non-stationarity**
    - **Suggests need for differencing in time series modeling**

**Forecasting**

- **ARIMA Model Performance:**
    - **Moderate predictive capability**
    - **Forecasts suggest stable production with minor fluctuations**
    - **Next 12 months predict slight variability around current levels**

**Key Observations**

- **Production ranges between 120-160 airplanes monthly**
- **Gradual decline in production over two decades**
- **Increasing volatility in recent years**
- **Potential industry challenges or market dynamics impact**
